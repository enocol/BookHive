BookHive is a Django-based web application and Minimum Viable Product (MVP) designed to showcase core full-stack functionality. The platform enables users to register, log in, browse books, post reviews, and initiate borrowing.

This project demonstrates my ability to build scalable, modular Django applications with clean UI using Bootstrap. While this version includes essential features, it is intentionally lean to highlight core functionality. The UX and feature set can be expanded based on future goals or user feedback.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enocol/bookhive.git
cd bookhive
```

### üöÄ Deployment Procedure

To deploy BookHive to a live production environment (e.g., Heroku), follow these steps:

#### 1. **Separate Settings for Development and Production**

* Create a `settings` package inside your Django project:

  ```bash
  mkdir project_name/settings
  mv project_name/settings.py project_name/settings/base.py
  touch project_name/settings/__init__.py
  cp project_name/settings/base.py project_name/settings/dev.py
  cp project_name/settings/base.py project_name/settings/prod.py
  ```
* Update `manage.py` and `wsgi.py` to use:

  ```python
  os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "project_name.settings.dev")
  ```
* In production (e.g., on Heroku), set:

  ```bash
  DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=project_name.settings.prod
  ```

#### 2. **Environment Variables**

Use `python-decouple` or `os.environ` to manage secrets:

```python
import os
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get("SECRET_KEY")
DATABASE_URL = os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL")
```

Set these in Heroku's config vars:

* `DATABASE_URL = <Heroku PostgreSQL URL>`
* `CLOUDINARY_URL` if using Cloudinary

#### 3. **Dependencies**

Ensure your `requirements.txt` includes:

```txt
django
whitenoise
dj-database-url
django-allauth
cloudinary
python-decouple
gunicorn
psycopg2-binary
```

#### 4. **Static and Media Files**

* Use WhiteNoise to serve static files:

  ```python
  MIDDLEWARE = [
    'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
    ...
  ]
  STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage'
  ```
* Run:

  ```bash
  python manage.py collectstatic
  ```

#### 5. **Database Setup**

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```



#### 7. **Differences Between Dev and Prod**

| Feature           | Development           | Production              |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `DEBUG`           | True                  | False                   |
| `ALLOWED_HOSTS`   | \['localhost']        | \['yourdomain.com']     |
| Database          | SQLite (default)      | PostgreSQL (Heroku)     |
| Static Files      | Django dev server     | WhiteNoise (compressed) |
| Media Storage     | Local                 | Cloudinary              |
| Secret Management | Plain `.env` or local | Heroku config vars      |

This process ensures BookHive is secure, modular, and scalable in a live environment.
